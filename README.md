# Sumerian-Nivkh-Analysis
A systematic quantitative analysis of lexical correspondences between Sumerian and Nivkh languages using the Swadesh list. This project applies computational methods (Damerau-Levenshtein distance, binomial testing) to evaluate potential historical connections between two geographically and temporally distant language isolates.
